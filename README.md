# RetroBuilder-3.0-N64

After much searching for easy methods to create LiveArea Bubbles using Retroarch, I stumbled across a video from SayianPrinceVegeta on Youtube detailing this process. This became my inspiration for RetroBuilder 3.0, automate this process as much as possible.

RetroBuilder 3.0 allows anyone to create Retroarch and DaedalusX64 Bubbles easy.

No more writing ROM paths. No more manually re-sizing or converting images. No more changing core.txt file every time you want to change the system. Storage capabilities for Bubble modification or archival purposes.

No additional software is required other than what is provided.

Everything is done by RetroBuilder.

Simply place the ROM file, bg, icon0 and startup PNGs in the Input Folder, select EasyVPK and then Name/ID it.

It's that simple.

(STARTUP.PNG IS OPTIONAL)
